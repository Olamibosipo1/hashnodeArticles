In this article, I will demonstrate how I used MSSQL for my mini-project on SQL

**Data Preparation**:

* I used a sample dataset provided by my tutor @[Jacob Ajala](@DataAnalyst)
    
* Here is the link to my dataset [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FDCIid2tDkCPm4X7FWLNsrwb5K\_7N-cB?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FDCIid2tDkCPm4X7FWLNsrwb5K_7N-cB?usp=sharing)
    
* I imported the data into MSSQL and cleaned it by removing duplicates and handling missing values."
    

**Database Design**:

* I designed a database with tables for Calender, Territory, products, Product Categories, Product Subcategories, customers, Sales data for years 2020, 2021, 2022 and ReturnData."
    
* I established relationships between tables using JOINS and UNION

Throughout this project, I've learned that Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) is a valuable tool for organizing and studying data. Whether you're someone who works with data or runs a business, knowing how to use SQL can help you understand your operations better.

Thank you for joining me on this journey.
